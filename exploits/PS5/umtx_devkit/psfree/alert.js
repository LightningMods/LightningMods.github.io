// We can't just open a console on the ps4 browser, make sure the errors thrown
// by our program are alerted. We use alert() instead of debug_log() because
// while we are developing, we may modify the utils.js module and introduce
// bugs. We can not use debug_log() if it throws an error.

// We log the line and column numbers as well since some exceptions (like
// SyntaxError) do not show it in the stack trace.
